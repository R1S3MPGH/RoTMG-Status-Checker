# RoTMG-Status-Checker
Simple C# project that uses a list box with all running programs inside of it and itll check every few seconds to see if the application "wServer" and "server" are running and if not it'll open them, this was made for RoTMG Private Server sources

# Notes
Run program as administrator so server.exe wont need uac prompt when it tries to open it

Put the program in same folder as server and wServer (bin/debug)
